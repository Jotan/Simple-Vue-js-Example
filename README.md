# Simple-Vue-js-Example
This is a simple vue js example for calculating waiting list on a plane services based with math.js

In this example, I use v-model, v-show and methods to call all equations for the waiting list. to use this example, you can clone the repository or
download all file and open index.html in a browser. for styles I use bootstrap.
